# canvas-as

A small canvas rendering framerwork powered by `AssemblyScript` ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

# Philosophy

This framework aims to solve the problem of calling canvas functions from wasm by creating a queue of instructions for javascript to interpret later. It's also painstaking to create ImagePatterns, CanvasPatterns and ImageBitmaps from within an AssemblyScript application, so canvas-as framework attempts to solve this problem by creating all the glue code and assembling all the patterns and gradients behind the scenes for you.

# Usage

## Installation

First, install `canvas-as` and `assemblyscript`:

```
npm install --save jtenner/canvas-as assemblyscript/assemblyscript
```
or...

```
yarn add jtenner/canvas-as assemblyscript/assemblyscript
```

## Start Assemblyscript

Then we need to create an `assemblyscript` project:

```
npx asinit .
```

or...

```
yarn asinit .
```

## Create the AssemblyScript entry point

Edit `assembly/index.ts` to contain the following things:

1. an import to `"../node_modules/canvas-as/assembly"` because we will consume the library directly
1. an `init(): void` function to be called after the wasm module is properly loaded
1. an `update(): void` function to be called once every time the `CanvasASInterop#update` function is called
1. a `draw(): Float64Array` function to be called once every time the `CanvasASInterop#draw` function is called

For example:

```ts
// You need to import your own allocator
import "allocator/tlsf";

// import CanvasRenderingContext2D and Image
import { CanvasRenderingContext2D, Image } from "./index";

let ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D = new CanvasRenderingContext2D();
let kitten: Image = new Image();
let rotation: f64 = 0;
let rotValue: f64 = Math.PI / 180.0;

export function init(): void {
  // You cannot load an image until the wasm module has been completely loaded
  kitten.src = "https://placekitten.com/300/300";
  // contexts must be initialized until the `constructor()` bugs are fixed in assemblyscript on the main branch
  ctx.init();
}

export function update(): void {
  // rotate the cat
  rotation += rotValue;
}

export function draw(): Float64Array {
  // perform some simple drawing calls
  ctx.clearRect(0.0, 0.0, 800.0, 600.0);
  ctx.save();
  ctx.translate(150.0, 150.0);
  ctx.rotate(rotation);
  ctx.translate(-150.0, -150.0);
  ctx.drawImagePosition(kitten, 0.0, 0.0);
  ctx.restore();

  // We must always return a reference to a `Float64Array`. The commit function is repurposed for the AssemblyScript context
  return ctx.commit();
}
```

## Glue Code Setup

The setup uses glue code provided by the `AssemblyScript` loader. Currently the only way to instantiate a `canvas-as` module is to use the constructor, and a fetch call.

```ts
// import the canvas interop
import { CanvasASInterop } from "canvas-as";

// create a context
const ctx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
const imports: any = {
  // put your imports here
};

// use an async function to load your module
async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const interop: CanvasASInterop = new CanvasASInterop(ctx, fetch("./path/to/optimized.wasm"), imports);

  // just need to wait for the module to instantiate
  await interop.loaded;

  // init() is called in assemblyscript for you

  // setup a request animation frame loop
  requestAnimationFrame(function loop() {
    requestAnimationFrame(loop);

    // call update() and draw()
    interop.update();

    // draw automatically passes the `Float64Array` reference to the internal `#render()` function
    interop.draw();
  });
}

main();
```

## OptimizedCanvasRenderingContext2D

This renderer is used when you want to minimize the number of javascript function calls. It's an exact drop in replacement for the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` class that only emits `setTransform`s and modified properties when they need to be modified.

For instance, take the following example.

```ts
var ctx = new OptimizedCanvasRenderingContext2D();

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(10.0, 10.0);
ctx.translate(100.0, 100.0);
ctx.lineTo(100.0, 100.0);
ctx.rotate(200.0);

// the above instructions are effectively ignored, except for the `rotate` and `translate` functions
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.rect(100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0);
ctx.stroke();
```

In this case, the first path created with `beginPath()` gets effectively ignored by the browser.

There is no reason to actually call those functions when `draw()` is called.

Instead, the `OptimizedCanvasRenderingContext2D` emits *no* instructions and waits until a `fill()` or a `stroke()` is called. Thus when it gets to the `ctx.stroke()` call, it checks to see if the transform changed since the last time the `transform` property was updated, and emits a single `setTransform()` instruction, a `rect()` instruction, and a `stroke()` instruction.

This costs more cpu power from within wasm, but doing cpu intensive things without garbage collection is what wasm does best!

## Using Parcel?

Note that when using `parcel-bundler`, you must use the `fs.readFileSync()` method to import your wasm into a buffer, since importing the wasm file directly bypasses the `assemblyscript` loader.  The following glue code is unfortunately necessary:

```ts
const fs = require("fs");
const buff = fs.readFileSync("./build/untouched.wasm");
const blob = new Blob([buff], { type: "application/wasm" });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const imports = {};

const interop = new CanvasAS.CanvasASInterop(ctx, fetch(url), imports);
```
